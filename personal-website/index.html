                <h2 class="section-title">Terragy: Reimagining Airport Energy</h2>
                <div class="project-intro fade-in">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>The airport industry moves people and goods globally, but aviation emissions heavily impact the environment. Jet fuel combustion releases greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide, which traps heat and warms the planet. While carbon dioxide supports plant life, at cruising altitudes there are no plants to absorb it, compounding the warming effect.</p>
                        <p>Terragy is a research and product initiative I created to help airports repay their environmental footprint by harvesting energy from existing airflows. The concept focuses on a self-sufficient turbine system designed to generate electricity with a minimal lifecycle carbon footprint. The core idea is to reimagine how to use Earth's energy to power critical airport systems.</p>

                        <h3>Product Purpose and Application</h3>
                        <p>The primary target is runway and airfield lighting: a turbine-based system harvesting the airflow generated by aircraft movements could offset a portion of the electrical load. Only a small fraction of airports are fully renewable today; many still rely on grid electricity with significant carbon intensity. This is where Terragy and its turbine concept (Plane.Aero) can provide clean, on-site power contributions.</p>

                    <div class="card fade-in">
                        <h3>Environmental and Economic Impact</h3>
                        <p>Terragy aims to create meaningful change across multiple dimensions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce the carbon footprint of airport operations</li>
                            <li>Provide a renewable electricity source for airfield lighting</li>
                            <li>Help airports save on electricity costs over time</li>
                            <li>Create opportunities for green jobs and education on sustainability</li>
                            <li>Support alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="card fade-in">
                        <h3>Real-World Context</h3>
                        <p>For example, Heathrow has initiatives to reduce emissions, including the use of LED lights. Typical LED airfield fixtures can be on the order of dozens of watts per unit, and Terragy's concept is to contribute to that load through localized generation. Exact power figures depend on light type, location, and operating conditions; the goal is to contribute meaningful energy where airflow is present.</p>
